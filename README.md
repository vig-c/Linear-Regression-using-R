# Predicting insurance charges using multiple linear regression
I conducted an analysis of the correlation between insurance charges and demographic and health-related characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. I used multiple linear regression analysis to predict insurance charges based on these variables, with the goal of aiding insurance companies in setting fair premiums and policymakers in designing effective public health policies to address healthcare costs.

To conduct the analysis, I utilized the Medical Cost Personal Dataset available on Kaggle, and my model was able to explain 86% of the variation in charges. I built three different multiple regression models to explain the variation in insurance charges using different predictor variables, with the third model being identified as the best fit for the data based on adjusted R-squared and F-test values.

To evaluate the accuracy of the model, I used various metrics and included three plots to visualize the predictions and residuals. Through the analysis, I concluded that age, the number of children, smoking status, and region are significant predictors of insurance charges. I was also able to provide estimates of the impact of each predictor variable on charges.

Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between insurance charges and demographic and health-related characteristics, and can be used by insurance companies and policymakers to make informed decisions.
